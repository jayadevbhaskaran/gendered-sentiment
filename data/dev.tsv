105	0	a	combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
106	1	a	the movie 's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast . 
107	0	a	what the director ca n't do is make either of val kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .

120	1	a	warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . 
121	0	a	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so 
122	1	a	old-form moviemaking at its best . 
123	1	a	turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
124	1	a	( lawrence bounces ) all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
125	1	a	a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it 's approached with imagination and flair . 
126	0	a	confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
127	0	a	in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
128	1	a	montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .

133	0	a	the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
134	0	a	it all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
135	0	a	pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut . 
136	0	a	looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen . 
137	0	a	forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
138	1	a	that is a compliment to kuras and miller . 
139	0	a	it 's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . 
140	0	a	sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
141	0	a	the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
142	1	a	what better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ? 
143	1	a	a solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
144	0	a	while ( hill ) has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
145	0	a	the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it . 
146	1	a	about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it 's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . 
147	0	a	the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second . 
148	0	a	feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
149	1	a	the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
150	1	a	overall very good for what it 's trying to do . 
151	1	a	a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . 
152	1	a	a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . 
153	0	a	the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
154	1	a	a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
155	0	a	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
156	1	a	manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
157	0	a	it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
158	0	a	by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
159	1	a	like leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
160	0	a	uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
161	0	a	not exactly the bees knees 
162	0	a	there seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there . 
163	0	a	slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
164	1	a	a woman 's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
165	0	a	may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
166	0	a	characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
167	0	a	the end result is a film that 's neither . 
168	1	a	manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time . 
169	1	a	leigh 's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom . 
170	1	a	it 's also , clearly , great fun . 
171	0	a	rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
172	1	a	it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i ca n't wait for the sequel . 
173	0	a	determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult . 
174	1	a	if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy ! 
175	1	a	bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
176	0	a	delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . 
177	0	a	does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
178	0	a	it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
179	1	a	the film 's performances are thrilling . 
180	0	a	unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
181	0	a	it 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
182	0	a	i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
183	0	a	the lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it . 
184	0	a	though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
185	1	a	a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking . 
186	1	a	pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
187	1	a	` de niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . ' 
188	0	a	a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
189	0	a	its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
190	0	a	try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! ' 
191	1	a	the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that 's all too rare in hollywood 's hastier productions . 
192	1	a	a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals ' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences . 
193	1	a	morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern 's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
194	1	a	instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
195	1	a	my thoughts were focused on the characters . 
196	1	a	so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today 's new delhi . 
197	0	a	for starters , the story is just too slim . 
198	1	a	this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world . 
199	0	a	at the very least , if you do n't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave . 
200	1	a	the format gets used best ... to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups . 
201	1	a	inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat . 
202	0	a	there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
203	0	a	bad . 
204	1	a	that dogged good will of the parents and ` vain ' jia 's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 
205	1	a	falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . 
206	1	a	an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre . 
207	1	a	smart , provocative and blisteringly funny . 
208	0	a	and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
209	0	a	this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
210	1	a	not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
211	0	a	to say this was done better in wilder 's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
212	0	a	the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad . 
213	0	a	this time mr. burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
214	0	a	perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
215	1	a	the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . 
216	1	a	the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
217	0	a	once ( kim ) begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
218	0	a	all that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
219	1	a	what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action . 
220	1	a	the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides ... ( and ) personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . 
221	0	a	my reaction in a word : disappointment . 
222	1	a	a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton 's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana . 
223	1	a	corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . 
224	1	a	nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
225	1	a	far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series . 
226	0	a	of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad . 
227	1	a	as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers . 
228	1	a	it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds . 
229	0	a	this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . 
230	1	a	reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
231	1	a	martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
232	0	a	it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish augmentation . 
233	0	a	i 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
234	1	a	affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
235	1	a	whether you like rap music or loathe it , you ca n't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie . 
236	1	a	not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa 's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur . 
237	0	a	a by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise . 
238	0	a	an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
239	1	a	brilliantly explores the conflict between following one 's heart and following the demands of tradition . 
240	1	a	despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
241	0	a	it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
242	0	a	it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong .
